Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Naveen,

I am writing to you from a futuristic spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a ghost white rocket in August. There are two trees and doors of secret here! 
In the tree room there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a Beautiful bed of wood 
and dream of swimming slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for 4 minutes. 
I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
jumping on a colorful boat!!


Best wishes,
Rutuja
