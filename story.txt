Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Naveen,

I am writing to you from a futuristic spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a ghost white rocket in August. There are [6] [7] and [8] of [9] here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a Beautiful bed of
wood and dream of swimming slowly. It feels as though I have lived here for
4 minutes. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
jumping on a colorful boat!!


Best wishes,
Rutuja
