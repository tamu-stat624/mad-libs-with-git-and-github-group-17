Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Naveen,

I am writing to you from a futuristic spaceship in a distant galaxy. I found myself here one day after going for a ride on a ghost white rocket in August. There are two trees and doors of secret here! In the tree room there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for 
4 minutes. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
jumping on a colorful boat!!


Best wishes,
Rutuja
